Make a 26-space vector with the real english letter frequencies
freq = [.017,.044,.052,.032,.028,.04 etc.] freq[0] is the % ‘a’ appears in a sentence freq[1] is the % ‘b’ appears etc.

write a distance formula function that works on 26 space vectors
for each rotation of our encoded sentence:
make a vector for that rotations frequenceis
calc the distance between that and the freq vector (form above)
the vector that’s closet to freq is probably our decoded sentence.

example:

If our rotation was: “aabbbcccce” We have 10 letters the vector for the above string is: [.2, .3, .4, 0, .1, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0 etc up to 26 letters]

compare that with freq above and check to see if it’s the closest.
